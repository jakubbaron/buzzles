Phase 1:
Get User View working with mock events from the Vendors
Milestones:
-> Single event detailed view
-> List of events with short description/photo
-> Mock sign up for the event 

Phase 2:
Get Vendor View working, allowing them to enter new events
  As from Phase 1 we would have completed single and list of events
  we could use it here but the vendors have access to modify their events

Milestones:
->Adding a new event
->Modify an event while being in a detailed view

Phase 3:
Add summarize view for the Vendors, to allow them to manage their
classes
  Create extra views for Vendors where they can see how much money
  they've made on each class
  Summarize all revenue from all the classes

Phase 4:
Social networks - allow people to see what their friends did,
Allow kids to sign up
